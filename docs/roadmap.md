## Overview

- Links
  DLSlime is dedicated to supporting efficient transmission over a variety of different links, including but not limited to IBVerbs, CUDA IPC, TCP Socket, PCIE, NVShmem, Ascend (Direct), ...

- Transfer Engine
  DLSlime provides a flexible and efficient P2P Transfer Engine, enabling AI-workload-aware customized functions such as Prefill-Decode separation and checkpoint transmission.

- Collective Ops
  Referring to [DeepEP](https://github.com/deeplink-org/DeepEP.git), DLSlime provides a buffer-based collective communication library that achieves ultra-low latency collective communications.
